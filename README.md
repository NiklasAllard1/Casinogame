Casino Simulator

Welcome to the Casino Simulator! This C# program allows you to experience the thrill of various casino games while managing your virtual balance. Dive into the world of chance and strategy as you choose from a selection of classic casino games.

Key Features:

Starting Balance: Begin with $1000 in your pocket.
Game Options:
Roulette (Option 1): Test your luck with the iconic spinning wheel.
Dicegame (Option 2): Roll the dice and see if you can multiply your winnings.
Slots (Option 3): Try your luck with the slot machine.
Keno (Option 4): Select your numbers and hope for a match in this lottery-style game.

Gameplay:

Your balance is displayed before each game.
Choose a game by entering the corresponding number.
Play the selected game, and your balance will be updated accordingly.
If your balance reaches $0, the casino adventure ends, and you'll be "thrown out" by the security.

Each game is implemented in separate classes (Roulette, Dicegame, Slots, and KenoGame) to encapsulate game logic and enhance modularity.
